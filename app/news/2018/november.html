                                <p class="intro">Compared to other tag and release databases that exist for skate in
                                    Scotland, Skatespotter is relatively
                                    new and only contains records for a handful of years so far (2011 – present day).
                                    However, we feel
                                    we have proved that photo ID is a valid tool for monitoring skate. We plan to
                                    continue collecting
                                    photos to monitor skate numbers within the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura MPA and
                                    we hope to
                                    expand the database to include other areas of Scotland.
                                </p>

                                <p>So far, we have included 1536 photos of 791 individual skate in the Skatespotter
                                    database, dating
                                    back to 2011. Out of these, 340 fish have been recaptured at least once (43%).
                                    Overall our volunteer
                                    skippers have caught significantly more females (530, or 67% of total) than males
                                    (258, or 33% of
                                    total). Of these, 111 (43%) males and 229 (43%) females have been recaptured at
                                    least once. The
                                    gender of three additional skates has not yet been determined from available photos.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Firth of Lorn</h2>
                                <p>In the Firth of Lorn, where most of the catch effort has been concentrated to date,
                                    600 individual fish
                                    have been captured and photographed, of which 48% have been recaptured at least
                                    once. In the Firth
                                    of Lorn, we’ve identified 206 (34%) males and 391 (65%) females, with 101 (49%)
                                    males and 185
                                    (47%) females being recaptured at least once.</p>

                                <p>IMAGE TO GO HERE</p>

                                <p>This is a discovery curve which can be used to estimate the approximate number of
                                    animals within a
                                    population. It plots the number of capture events over time against the number of
                                    new skate
                                    captured. As the number of capture events increases over time, the curve will level
                                    out as you get
                                    more recaptures and stop identifying new fish. If you have enough data, you can
                                    extrapolate the
                                    curve forwards to see where it may level out – which provides an estimated maximum
                                    number of fish
                                    in the area. As you can see in our discovery curve for the Firth of Lorn, the curve
                                    is beginning to level
                                    out. This suggests that there may be just over 600 skate in the area, so there
                                    probably aren’t many
                                    more new ones to be found! It isn’t that simple of course! The situation is
                                    complicated by the fact
                                    that we are likely to have some resident skate and some more transient skate which
                                    pass through the
                                    area (and we aren’t sure of the ratio of residents to transients), so we do expect
                                    to capture new fish
                                    as we continue monitoring the MPA and our estimate of population by this method may
                                    change. We
                                    intend to also use the data to more accurately estimate the population size using
                                    advanced modelling
                                    techniques, now that we have 3 years of photo ID data. This involves entering the
                                    various capture and
                                    recapture events of all the skate in our database into a computer programme. The
                                    programme allows
                                    you to estimate the number of skate in the site, based on various assumptions about
                                    factors affecting
                                    their survival rates from one year to the next (such as amount of food present,
                                    natural life
                                    expectancy, rates of migration etc.). It can also allow you to see what might happen
                                    to the population
                                    if any of those factors were to change. It will be interesting to compare the
                                    results of the 2 methods.</p>

                                <h2>Sound of Jura</h2>
                                <p>In the Sound of Jura, our volunteer skippers have submitted photos of 191 skate so
                                    far with 29% of
                                    skate being recaptured at least once. The recapture rate in the Sound of Jura is
                                    currently lower than
                                    the Firth of Lorn because we haven’t got as many useable photos dating back as far -
                                    we expect the
                                    recapture rate for this site will catch up to the Firth of Lorn at some point! Fifty
                                    two male fish have
                                    been identified but only 10 of these have been recaptured at least once as of
                                    November 2018 (19% of
                                    total). Of the 139 females in the Sound of Jura, 44 or 31% have been recaptured at
                                    least once so far.</p>
                                <p>IMAGE TO GO HERE</p>
                                <p>This is the discovery curve for the Sound of Jura so far, it is estimating the number
                                    of skate at this site
                                    to be around 270. This seems quite low since the deep water habitat preferred by
                                    skate spreads from
                                    Crinan to Northern Ireland and skate tagged in previous tagging studies at Crinan
                                    have been
                                    recaptured in Northern Ireland. The low estimate could be because we don’t have
                                    enough data yet or
                                    because the photos we have received for the Sound of Jura are only from a small area
                                    in the north of
                                    the site.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Recaptures</h2>
                                <p>The skate differ in their captures rates, with some fish only caught once whilst
                                    others have been
                                    encountered several times suggesting some skate stick around in the MPA (residents)
                                    while others
                                    range more widely, leaving the site and returning occasionally (transients). So far,
                                    our most frequently
                                    recorded fish is Di000122, a 160lb female from the Firth of Lorn. She was first
                                    photographed in
                                    October 2015 and has since been caught a further 14 times - most recently on the
                                    15th of September
                                    2018! The prize for most frequently recorded male goes to skate Di000289. So far,
                                    he’s been caught a
                                    total of 12 times, between March 2016 and August 2018. Skate Di000289 is fairly
                                    small, weighing in at
                                    58lb and, like several other fish in the database, he is missing the end of his
                                    tail. In total we have 11
                                    skate in the database (1.4%) with some sort of scarring (damaged tail, cheek scars)
                                    that we believe
                                    occurred as result of being captured by accident by mobile gear vessels (bycatch)
                                    and being poorly
                                    handled before or during release. Perhaps the most noteworthy of these is Di000063,
                                    a large female
                                    with a broken rostrum (or nose) and cheek scars who has been recorded 5 times
                                    between the 24th
                                    May 2015 and the 5th May 2017. </p>

                                <p>Even though we have a high recapture rate, lots of time can pass between recaptures.
                                    For example,
                                    we first photographed Di000010 on the 1st of April 2012. She wasn’t caught again
                                    until 1124 days, or
                                    3 years and 9 days, later, on the 30th of April 2015. Likewise, skate Di000006 had
                                    1098 days, or 3 years
                                    and 3 days, between her first and second photos. Occasionally, but rarely, a fish
                                    will get caught twice
                                    on the same day, like skates Di000246, Di000315 and Di000469. In the case of
                                    Di000315 and
                                    Di000469, the skate were caught twice on the same day by the same skipper on the
                                    same fishing
                                    mark only a few minutes apart (2 hours and 22 minutes and 3 hours and 40 minutes,
                                    respectively)
                                    both on the 26th of March 2018! Skate Di000246 was captured by different skippers on
                                    the same day,
                                    at 11:07 and 14:46 on the 20th of April 2017 on 2 different fishing marks almost
                                    700m apart off
                                    Kerrera. Some fish have been caught a few times but with weirdly evenly spaced
                                    recaptures. For
                                    example, Di000015 has been caught on three occasions, always 2 years apart in 2013,
                                    2015 and 2017.
                                    Maybe we will see her again in 2019?</p>

                                <h2>Big skate!</h2>
                                <p>The common skate is the largest skate species in Europe, so it is no surprise that we
                                    have some
                                    massive skate in our database. As most of you know, female skate grow much larger
                                    than males and
                                    our biggest 3 fish are all females. Di000206 is the largest one so far, estimated at
                                    222lb from her
                                    length and width on the 2nd of May 2018 – that’s over 100kg! She was previously
                                    estimated as 219lb
                                    (99kg) when she was captured just under a year earlier on the 14th of May 2017.
                                    Close behind are
                                    Di000396 and Di000098, both at 219lb (99 kg). Not only are these gargantuan fish
                                    over 89 inches
                                    (2.2m) long, they are both over 69 inches (1.75m) wide. That’s the same as the
                                    average Scottish man
                                    is tall! Di000396 has been measured 6 times in total, with her recorded weight
                                    fluctuating from 216lb
                                    (98kg) to 219lb (99kg). Meanwhile, Di000098 was first measured on the 17th of March
                                    2016 weighing
                                    216lb (98kg). When she was recaptured 2 years later, she was 219lb (99kg). The two
                                    largest males so
                                    far are Di000221 and Di000744, at 138 (63kg) and 136lb (62kg) respectively. As most
                                    of you know, the
                                    values for weight are estimated by comparing the length and width to tables with
                                    known values for
                                    skate. Just a reminder to be as accurate as possible when recording widths, lengths
                                    and weights!</p>

                                <h2>Skate movements</h2>
                                <p>To date, all our skate are from the Firth of Lorn or Sound of Jura. Even though these
                                    areas are close to
                                    each other (see the map below), so far, only two of the fish in our database have
                                    definitely made the
                                    journey between the two areas. Di000424 was first caught in the Sound of Jura on the
                                    2
                                    nd of
                                    September 2017. She was then recaptured 335 days later on the 3
                                    rd of August 2018 in the Firth of
                                    Lorn, over 40km away as the crow flies! In reality, she would probably have swum an
                                    even greater
                                    distance, likely navigating through the deep channels between the 2 sites. Di000228
                                    has also travelled
                                    between the two areas. He was originally caught in the Firth of Lorn on the 14th
                                    March 2016. Just over
                                    a month later on the 29th of April, he was recaught – this time in the Sound on
                                    Jura! He has since been
                                    caught another 5 times, most recently the 27th of October 2017, and all in the Firth
                                    of Lorn.
