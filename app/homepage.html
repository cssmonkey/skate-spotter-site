                        <p class="intro">Common or flapper skate (<i>Dipturus intermedius</i>) are the largest skates in
                            UK waters, reaching lengths of over 6’ (2m) and weights of over 200lbs (90kg). </p>
                        <p>Once common,
                            they have suffered large declines in population numbers, and the species is now very rare
                            or extinct across most of its natural range. <a href="https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/safeguarding-protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/national-designations/marine-protected-areas/nature-conservation-5 "
                                target="_blank">The Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura Marine Protected Area (MPA)</a> is
                            designated to help protect the common skate in Argyll waters.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aqc.2937" target="_blank">Researchers
                                from SAMS and SNH have shown</a> that skates can be identified from the spot patterns
                            on their backs. This has led to the compilation a ‘Residents Catalogue’ and database
                            containing the best photo of each skate identified in the MPA. Being able to identify
                            individual skates will eventually allow researchers to estimate the size of the skate
                            population in the MPA and how this changes over time. If anglers can also indicate the
                            general area where the skate was caught, this will help to study skate movements within the
                            MPA over time. All of this will help the long-term conservation of skates in Argyll and
                            across Scotland.</p>
                        <p>We would also like to receive your skate photos from elsewhere in Scotland; this
                            will allow us to begin building residents catalogues for other areas and check for longer
                            range skate movements.</p>
                        <p>This project relies on anglers continuing to submit photographs. We welcome any
                            and all photographs: please click <a href="upload.html">here</a> to upload (or select
                            "Upload" on the Menu). For advice on how to take the best picture of your skate, click <A

                        <p>To view images of skates already uploaded and catalogued by the Skatespotter

                        <p>We are continually working on the catalogue and hope to update it every 3 months
                            or so. Please check back often to see if your photo has been added.</p>
